#Encoder Library#

Encoder lets you use encoders with a very low processor footprint. This should minimize the time needed to process encoder usage so that programs execute smoothly.

Two interrupts must be available to use this library. They must be attached to state-change on your encoder pins, and reference your encoder's "readPins" function.
